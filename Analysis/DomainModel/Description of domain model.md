The domain model for Traffic Camera Browser captures the data needed to support the system use cases: registration/login, viewing live traffic cameras, viewing past playback, managing favorites, viewing browsing history, and administering cameras. A User is identified by an email and stores authentication information. A specialized Admin inherits from User and includes a role attribute to represent administrative privileges. The Camera entity contains the camera’s stream URL, active status, and geographic coordinates so the platform can display cameras on a map. Users personalize the system through Favorite records, which associate a user with a camera they want to quickly access. User activity is captured through HistoryEntry, which stores when a camera was viewed and whether it was viewed as live or playback. For retroactive browsing (last 72 hours), a user creates a PlaybackRequest that specifies a time window for a camera. Cameras also provide stored video through RecordingSegment objects, representing time-based video segments available for playback.
